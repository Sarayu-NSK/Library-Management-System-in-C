# Library-Management-System-in-C
In general, the library management system software is cloud-based. Its basic function is to store all the data about the materials found in a 
library in a secured cloud data storage. Aside from that, it helps the management maintain a smooth flow of materials in the library.
The main objective of the Project on Library Management System is to manage the details of Books available, Students, Librarian and the users
in a more user friendly and simple manner using technology.
